Welcome to participate in the first Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC 2016)! 


This directory contains the training data for the challenge. There are five source speakers and five target speakers, listed as:

Source speakers: SF1, SF2, SF3, SM1, SM2
Target speakers: TF1, TF2, TM1, TM2, TM3

('S' denotes 'source', 'T' denotes 'target', while 'M' and 'F' for 'male' and 'female', respectively.)

Each speaker utters the same sentence set consisting of 162 sentences. A number ID from 100001 to 100162 is used as the file name. The same file name means the same linguistic content. For example, './vcc2016_training/SF1/100001.wav' and './vcc2016_training/TF1/100001.wav' is a pair of parallel utterances, which have the same linguistic content.

The waveforms in the directory are in RIFF/WAVE format. The sampling rate is 16 kHz, and stored in 16-bit format.

As a participant, you are supposed to build voice conversion systems for all the 25 source-target speaker pair combinations, for example,
SF1 -> TF1
SF1 -> TF2
SF1 -> TM1 
SF1 -> TM2 
SF1 -> TM3 
...
...
...
SM2 -> TF1 
SM2 -> TF2
SM2 -> TM1 
SM2 -> TM2 
SM2 -> TM3

More details about the challenge can be found via the official website: http://vc-challenge.org/

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the organisers via email: vcc2016@vc-challenge.org

(Evaluation data will be release on January 8th, 2016)
